# Setup

```shell
npm install 

# server set to run on port 1234
mtunnel-server --port 1234
```

The localtunnel server is now running and waiting for client requests on port 1234. You will most likely want to set up a reverse proxy to listen on port 80 (or start localtunnel on port 80 directly).

**NOTE** By default, localtunnel will use subdomains for clients, if you plan to host your localtunnel server itself on a subdomain you will need to use the _--domain_ option and specify the domain name behind which you are hosting localtunnel. (i.e. my-tunnel-server.example.com)
